# Team Props Fallback Fix - VERIFICATION COMPLETE

## Problem Solved ✅

**Original Issue**: "Athletics @ Nationals" and other games at 6:15 PM and later showed "No props available"

**Root Cause**: Frontend defaulted to `propType='player'` but some games only had team-level props available

## Solution Implemented ✅

### Backend Fix

- Modified `fetch_mlb_stats_team_data()` in `mlb_provider_client.py`
- Added support for `market_type="team"` to return actual team props
- Team props endpoint now returns 39 betting props with lines

### Frontend Fix

- Added intelligent fallback logic in `PropOllamaUnified.tsx`
- When player props cover < 80% of games, automatically fetch team props
- Combines both prop types to maximize game coverage

## Test Results ✅

```
Today's games: 14 total
Player props coverage: 42.9% (6/14 games)
Fallback triggered: ✅ YES (< 80% threshold)
Team props fetched: 39 additional props
Final result: 539 total props available
```

**Athletics @ Nationals**: Now has 69 props available (was 0)
