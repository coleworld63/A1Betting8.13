## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Data Flow Optimization

```
SportRadar/TheOdds APIs → Unified Pipeline → Optimized Redis → Consolidated Cache → React Components
```

### Key Optimizations

- **Pipeline Batching**: 100ms window, deduplicate identical requests
- **Redis Pipeline**: Batch operations reduce round trips by 5-10x
- **Parallel Processing**: 25 concurrent requests with 50-item batches
- **Intelligent Caching**: Multi-level with automatic invalidation
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic failover for external API failures
