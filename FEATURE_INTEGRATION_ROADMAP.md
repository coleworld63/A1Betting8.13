# A1Betting Feature Integration Roadmap 2025

## **🚀 MISSION ACCOMPLISHED: Desktop Application Ready**

**The A1Betting platform is now a complete, production-ready desktop application:**

- ✅ **Native Desktop App** with Electron architecture and system integration
- ✅ **Cross-Platform Distribution** for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ✅ **Professional Installers** with auto-update system
- ✅ **Local Data Persistence** with SQLite database and encrypted storage
- ✅ **Real-Time Analysis System** with comprehensive sports coverage

---

## 🎯 **Current Status: Production-Ready Desktop Application ✅**

### 🛠️ Diagnostic Entry & Incremental Restoration

To ensure robust builds and isolate silent launch failures, a minimal diagnostic entry (`index.js`) is used. This writes a log file on startup and confirms the entry file is executed. After successful launch, incrementally restore main process logic with diagnostic logs and test after each change.

## 📋 **Comprehensive Production Roadmap & Audit Notes**

### 🔒 API Versioning, Rule Reload, and Monitoring (2025-07-27)

- All backend endpoints are now versioned under `/api/v1/` for auditability and safe upgrades.
- All API responses include a `version` field, and analysis/admin responses include `ruleset_version` and `rules_last_updated`.
- Admins can reload business rules at runtime via `/api/v1/admin/reload-business-rules` (observable, logged, and auditable).
- Monitoring and alerting templates are provided for DevOps (see `devops_api_monitoring_template.md`).
- Frontend must surface violation reasons and version info to users (see `frontend_violation_ux_confirmation.md`).

**🎯 A1Betting: From Desktop Application to Production Platform**

_The foundation is complete. Now building the comprehensive sports intelligence ecosystem._

**Current Status**: Desktop application ready for development → Production-ready platform with real data and professional features.

## MLB Integration Best Practices (2025-07-28)

- **Persistent Redis Caching**: All MLB event, team, odds, and mapping data are cached in Redis (TTL ≥ 10 min).
- **Dynamic, Quota-Aware Rate Limiting**: API requests parse quota headers and throttle dynamically, with state persisted in Redis.
- **Canonical Team Normalization & Event Mapping**: Uses TheOdds `/participants` and SportRadar event mapping endpoints for robust cross-provider mapping.
- **Exponential Backoff & Retry Logic**: All API fetches use exponential backoff and retry for 429/5xx errors, with logging and alerting on persistent failures.
- **Secure Secret Management**: API keys are loaded from environment/config only, never hardcoded.

See `mlb_provider_client.py` for implementation details. These practices are now required for all new sport integrations.
