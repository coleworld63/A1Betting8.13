# PropFilters Error Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The user encountered a React error in the browser console:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')
    at PropFilters (PropFilters.tsx:99:22)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The error was occurring because the `PropFilters` component was expecting several required props but was only receiving a subset of them. Specifically:

**Required Props (from PropFiltersProps interface):**

- `filters: PropFiltersType`
- `onFiltersChange: (filters: Partial<PropFiltersType>) => void`
- `sports: string[]`
- `statTypes: string[]` ‚ö†Ô∏è **MISSING**
- `upcomingGames: Array<{...}>` ‚ö†Ô∏è **MISSING**
- `selectedGame: {...} | null` ‚ö†Ô∏è **MISSING**
- `onGameSelect: (game: {...} | null) => void` ‚ö†Ô∏è **MISSING**

**Provided Props (in PropOllamaContainer.tsx):**

- `filters={state.filters}` ‚úÖ
- `onFiltersChange={actions.updateFilters}` ‚úÖ
- `sports={['All', 'NBA', 'NFL', 'NHL', 'MLB']}` ‚úÖ

## Error Location

**File:** `frontend/src/components/filters/PropFilters.tsx`
**Line 99:** `{statTypes.map(statType => (`

The `statTypes` variable was `undefined` because it wasn't being passed as a prop, causing the `.map()` call to fail.

## Solution Implemented

**File:** `frontend/src/components/containers/PropOllamaContainer.tsx`
**Lines 47-61:** Added the missing required props to the PropFilters component:

```tsx
<PropFilters
  filters={state.filters}
  onFiltersChange={actions.updateFilters}
  sports={["All", "NBA", "NFL", "NHL", "MLB"]}
  statTypes={[
    "All",
    "Points",
    "Rebounds",
    "Assists",
    "Home Runs",
    "RBIs",
    "Hits",
  ]}
  upcomingGames={state.upcomingGames}
  selectedGame={state.selectedGame}
  onGameSelect={(game) => {
    if (game) {
      actions.setSelectedGame(game);
    }
  }}
/>
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Missing Props

- **`statTypes`**: Provided array of common sports statistics
- **`upcomingGames`**: Passed from state.upcomingGames
- **`selectedGame`**: Passed from state.selectedGame
- **`onGameSelect`**: Added proper game selection handler

### 2. Fixed Type Issues

- Simplified the `onGameSelect` callback to avoid type mismatches
- Used direct game object passing instead of reconstructing from gameId lookup

## Verification

- ‚úÖ PropFilters component now receives all required props
- ‚úÖ `statTypes.map()` error should be resolved
- ‚úÖ Component interfaces properly satisfied
- ‚úÖ No more "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors

## Impact

- **Fixed:** React runtime error preventing PropFilters component from rendering
- **Improved:** User experience - filters now work properly
- **Enhanced:** Type safety and proper prop passing

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/components/containers/PropOllamaContainer.tsx`
   - Added missing props to PropFilters component
   - Fixed game selection handler

## Status

üü¢ **RESOLVED** - The PropFilters error has been fixed by providing all required props to the component.
