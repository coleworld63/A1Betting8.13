## Updated Roadmap: Ultimate Sports Betting Analysis Platform

### 1. Data Architecture & Historical Data

- [ ] Design scalable schema for games, teams, players, odds, results, and events
- [ ] Integrate large historical datasets (multiple seasons, all major sports)
- [ ] Implement efficient indexing and partitioning for fast queries
- [ ] Plan for migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL/cloud DB as needed
- [ ] Build ETL pipelines for ingesting and updating historical data from trusted sources

### 2. Model Registration & Migration System

- [x] Centralize SQLAlchemy Base definition (`models/base.py`)
- [x] Ensure all models import Base from `models/base.py`
- [x] Create `models/__all_models__.py` to register all models
- [x] Update `database.py` and `alembic/env.py` to import Base and all models
- [ ] Clean up duplicate imports and ensure DRY structure in migration scripts
- [ ] Confirm Alembic autogenerate and upgrade create all tables correctly

### 3. Machine Learning & Analytics

- [ ] Define requirements for ML model training on historical data
- [ ] Plan for model registry, versioning, and retraining workflows
- [ ] Build dashboards for trend analysis, backtesting, and prediction visualization

### 4. Security & Compliance

- [ ] Implement encrypted storage for sensitive data and API keys
- [ ] Plan for GDPR/CCPA compliance and regular security audits

### 5. User Experience & Advanced Features

- [ ] Design frontend for historical data exploration and visualization
