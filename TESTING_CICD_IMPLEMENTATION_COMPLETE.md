- **Quality Gate & Deployment:**
  - Comprehensive validation before deployment
  - Staging deployment preparation
  - Artifact management and retention

### 4. Docker Containerization & Deployment

**Production-ready containerization:**

- **`Dockerfile`** - Multi-stage build:
  - Frontend build optimization with Node.js
  - Python backend with proper dependencies
  - Security hardening with non-root user
  - Health checks and proper port exposure
  - Optimized layer caching for faster builds

- **`docker-compose.yml`** - Full-stack orchestration:
  - Application container with environment configuration
  - PostgreSQL database with initialization scripts
  - Redis caching with memory optimization
  - Nginx reverse proxy for production
  - Volume management and network isolation
  - Health check dependencies and restart policies
