# DevOps/API Monitoring Template: Business Rule Reloads & API Versioning

## Purpose

This template is for DevOps and monitoring teams to ensure:

- Business rule reloads are observable and auditable.
- Alerts are triggered on rule reloads, failures, or API version mismatches.

## Checklist

- [ ] Monitoring is set up for the `/admin/reload-business-rules` endpoint (success/failure events).
- [ ] Alerts are configured for failed reloads (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty, email).
- [ ] API version mismatches (backend `version` field != expected) are logged and alerted.
- [ ] All rule reloads are logged with timestamp, user, and outcome.
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards show current `ruleset_version` and `rules_last_updated`.
- [ ] Attach screenshots or links to monitoring dashboards and alert configs.

## Evidence

- Attach screenshots, alert config snippets, or monitoring dashboard links here.
- List any relevant code snippets or PR links.
