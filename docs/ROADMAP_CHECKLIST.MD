# A1Betting8.13 â€” Development Roadmap Checklist (Phase 5+)

This roadmap is optimized for execution by the GitHub Copilot agent.
Each task should be completed in order, committed separately, and marked as complete.

---

## âœ… Phase 1: API Contract Compliance (DONE)
- [x] Scan all `backend/routes/` for violations
- [x] Replace `HTTPException` â†’ `BusinessLogicException` / `AuthenticationException`
- [x] Enforce `response_model=StandardAPIResponse[...]` on all endpoints
- [x] Standardize all returns to `ResponseBuilder.success()` or `.error()`

---

## ðŸš€ Phase 2: Backend Refinement & Optimization

### 2.1 â€” Type Safety & Hints
- [x] Add strict type hints to **all** functions in:
  - [x] `backend/services/`
  - [x] `backend/core/`
  - [x] `backend/models/`
  - [x] `backend/utils/`
- [ ] Fix any `Any` types where a concrete type can be used
- [x] Add `from __future__ import annotations` to all backend Python files

### 2.2 â€” Response & Error Consistency
- [x] Audit `BusinessLogicException` error codes for duplicates / unclear naming
- [x] Consolidate into `backend/constants/error_codes.py`
- [x] Add automated test to validate all API error codes are unique

### 2.3 â€” Performance & Caching
- [x] Review all `@lru_cache` and `cache.set()` calls
- [x] Implement Redis caching for:
  - [x] Frequently accessed read-only endpoints
  - [x] Model prediction results with TTL
- [x] Add cache invalidation logic on relevant data updates

---

## Phase 3: Frontend Enhancement & Optimization

### 3.1 State Management Review
- [x] Remove unused store slices
- [x] Consolidate store logic where appropriate  
- [x] Add performance optimizations
- [x] Document state flow

### 3.2 â€” Component Optimization
- [x] Replace heavy components with lazy-loaded versions:
  - [x] InteractiveSHAPDashboard â†’ LazySHAPDashboard
  - [x] UnifiedAIPredictionsDashboard â†’ LazyPredictions
  - [x] Large prediction tables with virtualization
- [x] Extract shared UI components (GlassCard, LoadingSpinner, ErrorDisplay, StatusBadge)
- [x] Add proper error boundaries and loading states

### 3.3 â€” UI/UX Consistency
- [x] Enforce design tokens from `/frontend/src/styles/tokens.css`
- [x] Standardize button sizes, colors, and variants
- [x] Add loading & error states for all API-driven components

---

## ðŸ“Š Phase 4: Testing & CI/CD

### 4.1 â€” Backend Tests
- [x] Add integration tests for:
  - [x] Authentication routes
  - [x] Prediction engine routes
  - [x] Portfolio optimization routes
- [x] Add contract tests to ensure API responses match `StandardAPIResponse`

### 4.2 â€” Frontend Tests âœ… **COMPLETE**

- [x] Add Vitest + React Testing Library tests for:
  - [x] Filters - Comprehensive test suite with filter validation, edge cases, and user interactions
  - [x] Predictions display - Display logic, SHAP explanations, sorting, and advanced metrics
  - [x] Error boundaries - Error catching, fallback UI, and recovery functionality

### 4.3 â€” CI/CD âœ… **COMPLETE**

- [x] Update GitHub Actions workflow:
  - [x] Run lint, type-check, tests on PR - Enhanced with caching and parallel execution
  - [x] Cache dependencies for faster builds - Multi-layer caching strategy implemented
  - [x] Deploy to staging after passing checks - Automated deployment with health checks
  - [x] Phase 4.2 test integration - All 48 component tests run in CI
  - [x] Performance testing with Lighthouse
  - [x] Security scanning with Trivy
  - [x] Docker build optimization with BuildKit

---

## âœ… Phase 5: API Consolidation & Documentation (COMPLETED)

- [x] Merge duplicate backend route files where possible
- [x] Consolidate admin-related routes into consolidated admin API
- [x] Update `API_AUDIT_REPORT.md` with final architecture diagram
- [x] Generate OpenAPI spec and publish at `/docs/openapi.json`
