# ADR-001: API Version Management Strategy

## Context

Our application integrates with evolving APIs that undergo versioning changes. We need a systematic approach to handle API versioning, deprecation notices, and migrations.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-layered API version management strategy:

1. **Centralized Version Registry**

   - Create a single source of truth for all API endpoints and their versions
   - Track deprecated endpoints and their replacement paths
   - Auto-generate version compatibility reports

2. **Graceful Degradation Pattern**

   - Try newest supported version first
   - Fall back to older versions with warning logs
   - Surface critical version mismatches to users via error boundaries

3. **Automated Version Testing**
   - Add API version compatibility tests to CI/CD
   - Create synthetic tests that verify all critical endpoints
   - Generate alerts for newly deprecated endpoints

## Status

Proposed

## Unified Error Handling Strategy (2025-08-05)

### Context

To support observability, debugging, and user experience, all errors in the system are now managed through a unified error handling system that leverages request correlation IDs.

### Key Features

- **Correlation IDs**: Every error (frontend and backend) is tagged with a unique correlation ID for traceability across distributed systems.
- **Frontend**: Global error store (Zustand), error boundary with correlation ID display/copy, HTTP error interceptor, and automatic error reporting to backend.
- **Backend**: Structured error responses with correlation IDs, custom exception classes for business/validation/auth errors, and consistent error logging.
- **Developer Experience**: All errors are categorized, recorded, and can be traced end-to-end using the correlation ID.

### Benefits

- Rapid debugging and support (users can provide correlation ID)
- End-to-end traceability for distributed requests
- Consistent error format and handling across all layers

### Next Steps

- Integrate error correlation with monitoring/alerting
- Expand error reporting and analytics
