# ADR-002: Model Degradation Strategy

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Machine learning models in the A1Betting platform may experience performance degradation over time due to:

- Data drift (changes in input data distribution)
- Concept drift (changes in the underlying relationships being modeled)
- Model staleness (models trained on historical data become less accurate)
- Infrastructure issues (service outages, resource constraints)
- External API changes (sports data providers modify their schemas)

Current ML architecture includes:

- Modern ML services with transformer and GNN models (`modern_ml_service.py`)
- Bayesian ensemble methods for uncertainty quantification (`advanced_bayesian_ensemble.py`)
- SHAP explainers for model interpretability (`real_shap_service.py`)
- A/B testing framework for model comparison (`modern_ml_integration.py`)
- Comprehensive prop generation with fallback mechanisms

However, we lack systematic monitoring for model degradation and automated fallback strategies.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive model degradation detection and response strategy with multiple fallback layers.

### Degradation Detection

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Track model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores over time
2. **Drift Detection**: Implement statistical tests for data and concept drift detection
3. **Prediction Confidence**: Monitor prediction confidence distributions and flag unusual patterns
4. **Business Impact**: Track downstream metrics (user engagement, revenue impact)

### Fallback Strategy Hierarchy

```text
Primary Model (Modern ML) → Ensemble Model → Legacy Model → Static Fallback
```

#### Level 1: Modern ML Models

- Transformer and GNN models with uncertainty quantification
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Automatic degradation detection

#### Level 2: Ensemble Methods

- Bayesian ensemble combining multiple models
- Weighted voting based on recent performance
- Confidence-based prediction selection

#### Level 3: Legacy Models

- Traditional ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Pre-trained models with known stable performance
- Rule-based systems for basic predictions

#### Level 4: Static Fallback

- Historical averages and statistical baselines
- Conservative predictions with wide confidence intervals
- Graceful degradation with user notifications

### Implementation Pattern

```python
class ModelDegradationManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.primary_model = modern_ml_service
        self.ensemble_model = advanced_bayesian_ensemble
        self.legacy_model = legacy_prediction_service
        self.static_fallback = statistical_baseline_service
        
    async def predict_with_fallback(self, input_data):
        for model_level in [self.primary_model, self.ensemble_model, 
                           self.legacy_model, self.static_fallback]:
            try:
                if self.is_model_healthy(model_level):
                    prediction = await model_level.predict(input_data)
                    if self.is_prediction_reliable(prediction):
                        return self.add_fallback_metadata(prediction, model_level)
            except Exception as e:
                self.log_model_failure(model_level, e)
                continue
        
        raise ModelDegradationError("All model levels failed")
```

### Monitoring and Alerting

- Real-time dashboards showing model performance across all levels
- Automated alerts when degradation thresholds are exceeded
- Weekly model performance reports with trend analysis
- Integration with observability strategy (ADR-001)

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Reliability**: System maintains prediction capability even when primary models fail
- **User Experience**: Users receive predictions with confidence indicators and fallback notifications
- **Business Continuity**: Revenue-generating features remain available during model issues
- **Observability**: Clear visibility into model health and performance trends
- **Automation**: Reduced need for manual intervention during model issues

### Negative Consequences

- **Complexity**: Multiple model layers increase system complexity and maintenance overhead
- **Performance**: Fallback logic adds latency to prediction requests
- **Resource Usage**: Maintaining multiple models requires additional computational resources
- **False Positives**: Overly sensitive degradation detection may trigger unnecessary fallbacks

### Neutral Consequences

- **Configuration**: Model thresholds and fallback rules become part of system configuration
- **Testing**: Requires comprehensive testing of all fallback scenarios
- **Documentation**: Need clear documentation of when each fallback level is used

## Related Decisions

- Builds on observability strategy (ADR-001) for monitoring and alerting infrastructure
- Influences WebSocket contract design (ADR-003) for real-time degradation notifications
- Future decisions about model retraining automation will extend this foundation

## Notes

- Implementation priority: degradation detection first, then fallback mechanisms
- Existing `modern_ml_integration.py` A/B testing framework provides foundation for gradual rollouts
- Consider implementing model shadow mode for testing degraded model performance
- Integration with existing `unified_error_handler.py` for consistent error reporting
- Model degradation thresholds should be sport-specific and configurable
- Consider using MLOps pipelines for automated model retraining when degradation is detected
