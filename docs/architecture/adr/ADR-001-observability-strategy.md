# ADR-001: Observability Strategy

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The A1Betting platform requires comprehensive observability to maintain high availability, performance, and reliability in production environments. We need to make architectural decisions about:

- How to collect, aggregate, and analyze system metrics, logs, and traces
- What observability tools and patterns to standardize on
- How to implement distributed tracing across microservices
- How to handle alerting, monitoring, and incident response
- What level of observability to implement without impacting performance

Current observability implementation includes:

- Structured JSON logging via `unified_logging.py`
- Performance monitoring with `PerformanceMonitor` singleton
- Health check endpoints (`/api/v2/diagnostics/health`)
- Error tracking through `unified_error_handler.py`
- WebSocket connection monitoring via `ws_registry.py`
- Bootstrap validation system for service health verification

However, we lack centralized log aggregation, distributed tracing, and comprehensive alerting systems.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive observability strategy based on the three pillars of observability: metrics, logs, and traces.

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Metrics Collection**: Standardize on Prometheus for metrics collection with custom metrics exposition via `/metrics` endpoint
2. **Logging Strategy**: Continue using structured JSON logging with centralized log aggregation via ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
3. **Distributed Tracing**: Implement OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing across all services
4. **Alerting**: Use Grafana for visualization and AlertManager for alerting rules
5. **Health Monitoring**: Expand current health check system with service dependency mapping

### Implementation Pattern

```python
# Observability integration pattern
from backend.services.observability import (
    metrics_collector,
    trace_provider, 
    structured_logger
)

@trace_provider.instrument()
@metrics_collector.time_execution()
async def business_operation():
    structured_logger.info("Operation started", {
        "trace_id": trace_provider.get_trace_id(),
        "operation": "business_operation"
    })
```

### Service Integration

- All unified services (`unified_*`) will expose metrics and tracing
- WebSocket connections will be fully traced
- ML model inference will include performance and accuracy metrics
- Database operations will be instrumented with connection pool metrics

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Improved Debugging**: Distributed tracing will significantly improve our ability to debug issues across services
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics and alerting will enable proactive issue detection
- **Performance Optimization**: Detailed performance metrics will guide optimization efforts
- **Compliance**: Structured logging and audit trails will support compliance requirements
- **Scalability**: Observable systems are easier to scale and optimize

### Negative Consequences

- **Performance Overhead**: Observability instrumentation adds 2-5% performance overhead
- **Complexity**: Additional infrastructure components (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK) increase operational complexity
- **Storage Costs**: Log and metric retention requires additional storage infrastructure
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs training on observability tools and practices

### Neutral Consequences

- **Configuration Management**: Observability settings become part of system configuration
- **Testing Strategy**: Integration tests must account for observability instrumentation
- **Deployment Pipeline**: CI/CD must include observability configuration validation

## Related Decisions

- This ADR influences model degradation strategy (ADR-002) by providing the monitoring foundation
- WebSocket contract design (ADR-003) must include observability considerations
- Future decisions about service mesh implementation will build on this foundation

## Notes

- Implementation will be phased: metrics first, then logging aggregation, finally distributed tracing
- Existing `unified_logging.py` and performance monitoring systems provide a solid foundation
- OpenTelemetry provides vendor-neutral instrumentation for future flexibility
- Consider service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) for automatic observability injection in future phases
