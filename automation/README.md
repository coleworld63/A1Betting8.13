# Automation Scripts

This directory contains example automation scripts for each stage of the sport-by-sport pipeline in A1Betting7-13.2.

## Scripts

- `etl_run.py`: Runs ETL for a given sport, logs results.
- `feature_engineering.py`: Extracts/transforms features, logs stats/anomalies.
- `train_model.py`: Retrains model, runs validation/backtests, logs metrics.
- `deploy_model.py`: Deploys model to API endpoint, runs smoke tests.
- `monitor_pipeline.py`: Monitors pipeline health, sends alerts on failures/anomalies.

## Usage

- Customize each script for your sport and pipeline requirements.
- Integrate with Docker Compose and CI/CD for reproducible, automated workflows.
- Use logging and monitoring to track pipeline health and performance.

## Integration

- Reference these scripts in `AUTOMATION_GUIDE.md` and your CI/CD workflows.
- Add sport-specific logic and alerting as needed.
