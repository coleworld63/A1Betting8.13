# 🎯 A1BETTING DATA FLOW RESTORATION - COMPLETE

## ✅ PROBLEM SOLVED

**Root Cause Identified**: User authentication session had expired. The React frontend was displaying the login screen instead of the main application, which is why no data was flowing to the PropOllamaContainer component.

## 🚀 SOLUTION

1. **Open the frontend**: http://localhost:5175
2. **Login with these credentials**:
   - 📧 **Email**: `ncr@a1betting.com`
   - 🔑 **Password**: `A1Betting1337!`
3. **Data flow will be fully restored!**
