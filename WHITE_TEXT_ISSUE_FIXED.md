## âœ… FIXED: White Text on White Background Issue

### ðŸŽ¨ Styling Issue Resolved

**Problem:** In the Live Game Stats component, the venue and status text were appearing as white text on a white background, making them invisible.

**Root Cause:**

- The game details section has `bg-white` (white background)
- The venue and status text had no explicit text color
- Default text color in the app appears to be white, causing invisible text

**Solution Applied:**

```tsx
// BEFORE (invisible text)
<span className='ml-2 font-medium'>{venue}</span>
<span className='ml-2 font-medium'>{game_state.status}</span>

// AFTER (visible dark text)
<span className='ml-2 font-medium text-gray-800'>{venue}</span>
<span className='ml-2 font-medium text-gray-800'>{game_state.status}</span>
```

**Changes Made:**

- Added `text-gray-800` class to venue text for dark gray color on white background
- Added `text-gray-800` class to status text for dark gray color on white background

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Status: FIXED

The Live Game Stats component now has proper text contrast:

- âœ… **Venue text**: Dark gray (`text-gray-800`) on white background
- âœ… **Status text**: Dark gray (`text-gray-800`) on white background
- âœ… **Other elements**: Already had proper color classes

### ðŸ“± Expected Visual Result:

In the Live Game Stats display, you should now clearly see:

- **Venue**: "Citizens Bank Park" in dark gray text
- **Status**: "In Progress" in dark gray text
- Both are easily readable against the white background

The text contrast issue has been resolved! ðŸŽ‰
