# Sport-by-Sport Workflow Automation Guide

This guide describes how to automate ETL, feature engineering, model training/evaluation, deployment, and monitoring for each sport in A1Betting7-13.2.

## Pipeline Overview

1. **Data Ingestion Automation**

   - Schedule ETL jobs for each sport using Airflow, cron, or Python scripts (e.g., `etl_run.py`).
   - Validate data integrity and completeness after each run.

2. **Feature Engineering Automation**

   - Trigger feature extraction/transformation scripts (e.g., `feature_engineering.py`) after ETL completion.
   - Log feature stats and anomalies for review.

3. **Model Training & Evaluation Automation**

   - Schedule regular model retraining (e.g., nightly/weekly) using scripts (e.g., `train_model.py`).
   - Run automated backtests and validation on new data.
   - Log model metrics and alert on performance drops.

4. **Deployment Automation**

   - Deploy updated models to API endpoints with versioning using CI/CD (GitHub Actions) and Docker Compose.
   - Run smoke tests and health checks post-deployment.

5. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Monitor ETL, feature, and model pipelines for failures or anomalies using scripts (e.g., `monitor_pipeline.py`), dashboards, and alerting tools.
   - Set up alerts for data gaps, model drift, or API errors (email, Slack, etc.).

## Example Automation Scripts

- `etl_run.py`: Runs ETL for a given sport, logs results.
- `feature_engineering.py`: Extracts/transforms features, logs stats/anomalies.
- `train_model.py`: Retrains model, runs validation/backtests, logs metrics.
- `deploy_model.py`: Deploys model to API endpoint, runs smoke tests.
- `monitor_pipeline.py`: Monitors pipeline health, sends alerts on failures/anomalies.

## Docker Compose Integration

Use `docker-compose.yml` to define reproducible environments for ETL, training, and deployment. Example:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  etl:
    build: ./etl
    command: python etl_run.py
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
  feature:
    build: ./feature
    command: python feature_engineering.py
    depends_on:
      - etl
  train:
    build: ./train
    command: python train_model.py
    depends_on:
      - feature
  deploy:
    build: ./deploy
    command: python deploy_model.py
    depends_on:
      - train
```

## CI/CD Integration (GitHub Actions)

Example workflow for automated testing and deployment:

```yaml
name: Model Pipeline Automation
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - "etl/**"
      - "feature/**"
      - "train/**"
      - "deploy/**"
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run ETL
        run: python etl/etl_run.py
      - name: Run Feature Engineering
        run: python feature/feature_engineering.py
      - name: Train Model
        run: python train/train_model.py
      - name: Deploy Model
        run: python deploy/deploy_model.py
      - name: Run Tests
        run: pytest
```

## Logging, Monitoring, and Alerting

- Log all pipeline steps, metrics, and anomalies to sport-specific log files.
- Use dashboards (Grafana, ELK) for transparency and monitoring.
- Set up alerts for failures, data gaps, model drift, and API errors (email, Slack, etc.).

## Best Practices

- Document all automation scripts and configs in the repo.
- Maintain sport-specific logs and dashboards.
- Review and iterate automation as new sports are added.

## Next Steps

- Implement and document automation scripts for each pipeline stage.
- Integrate monitoring and alerting for all critical steps.
- Review and iterate automation as new sports are added.
