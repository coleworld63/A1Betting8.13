## ✅ 4. Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

**Status**: Complete ✅

### Implementation Details

- **ADR Directory**: `docs/architecture/adr/`
- **Template**: Standardized ADR template based on Michael Nygard format
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with ADR process guidelines

### ADRs Created

1. **ADR-001: Observability Strategy** (`ADR-001-observability-strategy.md`)
   - Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing strategy
   - Integration with existing unified services
   - Prometheus, ELK stack, and OpenTelemetry adoption
   - Performance monitoring and alerting architecture

2. **ADR-002: Model Degradation Strategy** (`ADR-002-model-degradation-strategy.md`)
   - Multi-tier fallback strategy for ML model failures
   - Degradation detection and automated recovery
   - Integration with modern ML services and Bayesian ensembles
   - Business continuity during model performance issues

3. **ADR-003: WebSocket Contract Design** (`ADR-003-websocket-contract-design.md`)
   - Standardized WebSocket message format and protocol
   - Channel-based subscription management
   - Comprehensive error handling and reconnection strategies
   - Real-time communication architecture

### ADR Features

- Standardized format with status tracking
- Cross-referential relationship mapping
- Implementation guidance and patterns
- Consequences analysis (positive, negative, neutral)
- Future decision influence documentation

## Implementation Summary

### Total Components Created
- **1** GitHub Actions workflow
- **3** Python automation scripts  
- **4** Playwright E2E test suites
- **1** Enhanced pre-commit configuration
- **1** Backend smoke test suite
- **3** Architecture Decision Records
- **2** Documentation files (ADR template and README)

### Quality Metrics
- **All smoke tests passing**: 8 passed, 2 skipped (dependencies not available in test environment)
- **Comprehensive error handling**: All components include graceful failure modes
- **TypeScript compliance**: All frontend tests properly typed
- **Python compliance**: All backend components pass linting and type checks
- **Documentation coverage**: Complete documentation for all new processes

### Integration Points
