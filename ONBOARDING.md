# Onboarding Checklist (Auto-Generated)

> This file is auto-generated by scripts/extract_digest_for_docs.py.
> For new contributors (AI or human).

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies (see Quick Start in README).
2. Review the README, API_REFERENCE.md, and roadmap.md.
3. Use function_index.json for code search and navigation.
4. Run tests and check health badges.
5. Make your changes and run scripts/extract_digest_for_docs.py to update docs.
6. Open a PR (tag with [AI] if you are an AI agent).
7. Ensure all auto-generated files are up to date.

8. Review CI audit workflow and dependency graphs:
   - The repository runs automated file usage and hygiene audits in CI (see `.github/workflows/code-audit.yml`).
   - Dependency graphs are generated for both frontend (`frontend-dependency-graph.svg`) and backend (`backend-dependency-graph.svg`).
   - Code hygiene reports are uploaded as CI artifacts for every push and PR.
   - Address any issues flagged by CI before merging.
