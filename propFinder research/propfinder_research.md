## PropFinder Research: Features and Potential Technology Stack

Based on the initial search, it appears there are multiple applications with similar names. Given the context of your application and 'PropGPT', the relevant 'PropFinder' is likely related to sports betting and player props. While explicit details on its technology stack are scarce, we can infer features and make educated guesses about its architecture.

### Key Features Identified:

*   **Player Dashboard:** Detailed player performance trends, matchup analysis, advanced statistics, and opponent-specific game logs (e.g., for NBA player props).
*   **Quick Glance Stats:** Designed to display relevant prop stats efficiently.
*   **Comprehensive Data Access:** Aims to democratize access to advanced sports betting data and tools.
*   **Personalized Alerts & Notifications:** Features like personalized alerts and push notifications for bet updates to boost engagement.
*   **Search Functionality:** Allows users to search for current prop markets by player or team.
*   **Multi-Sport Support:** Mentions MLB, NBA, WNBA, NFL, etc.

### Inferred Technology Stack (Likely):

Given the nature of a modern sports betting data application, the following technologies are highly probable:

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Frameworks:** React, Vue, or Angular are common choices for interactive web applications. React (as used in your project) is a strong candidate due to its component-based architecture and large ecosystem.
    *   **State Management:** Redux, Zustand, or React Context for managing complex application state, especially with real-time data.
    *   **Charting Libraries:** Libraries like Chart.js, D3.js, or Plotly.js for visualizing player trends, historical data, and statistical distributions.
    *   **UI Libraries:** Material-UI, Ant Design, or Tailwind CSS for consistent and responsive UI components.
    *   **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets for live odds updates, score changes, and personalized alerts.
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Language/Framework:** Python (with FastAPI/Django/Flask), Node.js (with Express), or Go are popular for high-performance APIs. Given the data processing and potential for AI/ML, Python is a very strong candidate.
    *   **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Redis for storing player data, historical stats, odds, and user preferences. A relational database like PostgreSQL is typical for structured sports data.
    *   **Data Ingestion/ETL:** Robust pipelines to pull data from various sports data providers (APIs like SportsDataIO, Sportradar, etc.). This often involves scheduled jobs and data transformation.
    *   **API Design:** RESTful APIs for data retrieval, and WebSocket endpoints for real-time updates.
    *   **Caching:** Redis or Memcached for caching frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve response times.
    *   **Analytics/AI:** If advanced predictions are involved (like in PropGPT), Python libraries for data science (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) and potentially machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) would be used.
*   **Infrastructure:**
    *   **Cloud Provider:** AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for hosting.
    *   **Containerization:** Docker for packaging applications.
    *   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes for managing containerized applications at scale.

### Comparison with Your Application (Initial Thoughts):

Your `A1Betting7-13.2` project already utilizes React for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend, which aligns well with the likely stack of a modern sports data application like PropFinder. The current challenges seem to be in the integration and stability between these layers, as well as the full implementation of advanced features.

**Next Steps:** The next phase will involve cloning and analyzing your repository to perform a direct comparison and provide specific, actionable instructions for improvement.
