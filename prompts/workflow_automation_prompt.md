# Workflow Automation for Sport-by-Sport Pipelines

## Goal

Automate the ETL, model training, evaluation, and deployment process for each sport to ensure rapid, reliable, and reproducible updates.

## Steps

1. **Data Ingestion Automation**

   - Schedule and monitor ETL jobs for each sport (e.g., via Airflow, cron, or custom scripts).
   - Validate data integrity and completeness after each run.

2. **Feature Engineering Automation**

   - Automatically trigger feature extraction and transformation scripts after ETL completion.
   - Log feature stats and anomalies for review.

3. **Model Training & Evaluation Automation**

   - Schedule regular model retraining (e.g., nightly, weekly) for each sport.
   - Run automated backtests and validation on new data.
   - Log model metrics and alert on performance drops.

4. **Deployment Automation**

   - Deploy updated models to API endpoints with versioning.
   - Run smoke tests and health checks post-deployment.

5. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Monitor ETL, feature, and model pipelines for failures or anomalies.
   - Set up alerts for data gaps, model drift, or API errors.

## Tools & Best Practices

- Use Docker Compose for reproducible environments.
- Integrate with CI/CD (GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment.
- Document all automation scripts and configs in the repo.
- Maintain sport-specific logs and dashboards for transparency.

## Next Steps

- Implement and document automation scripts for each pipeline stage.
- Integrate monitoring and alerting for all critical steps.
- Review and iterate automation as new sports are added.
