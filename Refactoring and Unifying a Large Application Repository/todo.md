## Phase 1: Repository Analysis and Code Audit
- [x] Clone the repository
- [x] Analyze repository structure and content
- [x] Review the provided gitingest file
- [x] Identify key areas for refactoring

## Phase 2: Architecture Assessment and Technology Stack Analysis
- [x] Document the current architecture
- [x] Detail the technology stack for frontend, backend, and development
- [x] Identify architectural patterns and anti-patterns
- [x] Assess the current state of integration between components

## Phase 3: File Classification and Dependency Mapping
- [x] Classify files by type and purpose
- [x] Map dependencies between modules and components
- [x] Identify unused or redundant files
- [x] Create a visual representation of dependencies (e.g., a dependency graph) - *Attempted, but current complexity prevents clear visualization, highlighting need for refactoring.*

## Phase 4: Best Practices Research and Modern Standards Analysis
- [x] Research modern software architecture patterns (e.g., microservices, modular monoliths)
- [x] Research best practices for React/TypeScript frontend development (e.g., state management, component design, performance optimization)
- [x] Research best practices for FastAPI/Python backend development (e.g., API design, dependency injection, testing, security)
- [x] Research best practices for containerization and deployment (Docker, Kubernetes)
- [x] Research best practices for CI/CD and automated testing
- [x] Document findings and identify applicable standards for A1Betting

## Phase 5: Refactoring Strategy and Implementation Plan Design
- [x] Define the overall refactoring strategy (e.g., incremental, big bang)
- [x] Outline the modular monolith design for the backend, including module identification and boundaries
- [x] Outline the component-based design for the frontend, including component hierarchy and state management
- [x] Propose a detailed plan for cleaning up redundant and unused files
- [x] Detail the approach for consolidating Dockerfiles and dependency management
- [x] Suggest a strategy for improving API design and integration between frontend and backend
- [x] Plan for enhancing automated testing and CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Document the refactoring strategy and implementation plan

## Phase 6: Integration and Unification Roadmap Creation
- [x] Develop a phased roadmap for integrating refactored components and modules
- [x] Outline the process for unifying the frontend and backend development workflows
- [x] Plan for data migration and consistency during the unification process
- [x] Define strategies for managing cross-module dependencies and communication
- [x] Document the integration and unification roadmap

## Phase 7: Implementation Guidelines and Best Practices Documentation
- [x] Create detailed coding guidelines for both frontend (React/TypeScript) and backend (FastAPI/Python)
- [x] Document best practices for code reviews and version control
- [x] Provide guidelines for testing, debugging, and performance profiling
- [x] Outline a strategy for ongoing maintenance and technical debt management
- [x] Document the implementation guidelines and best practices

## Phase 8: Deliver Comprehensive Refactoring Plan to User
