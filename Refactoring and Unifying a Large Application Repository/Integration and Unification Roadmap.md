    -   Create the `core`, `auth`, and `users` modules.
    -   Migrate the FastAPI application instance, database configuration, and authentication logic.
    -   Refactor the user management API endpoints.
-   **Frontend:**
    -   Refactor the authentication components (login, registration) to align with the new backend API.
    -   Improve the state management for user authentication.
-   **Integration:**
    -   Integrate the refactored frontend authentication components with the new backend authentication API.
    -   Ensure seamless user login and registration.
-   **Testing:**
    -   Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for the `auth` and `users` modules.
    -   Perform end-to-end testing of the authentication flow.

### Phase 2: Sports Data and Odds Module Integration (Weeks 5-8)

-   **Goal:** Refactor the sports data and odds management functionalities.
-   **Backend:**
    -   Create the `sports` and `odds` modules.
    -   Migrate the data ingestion and management logic for sports data and odds.
    -   Refactor the corresponding API endpoints.
-   **Frontend:**
    -   Refactor the components that display sports data and odds.
    -   Optimize the performance of data-intensive components using virtualization and memoization.
-   **Integration:**
    -   Integrate the refactored frontend components with the new backend sports and odds APIs.
    -   Ensure that real-time odds updates are handled efficiently.
-   **Testing:**
    -   Develop unit and integration tests for the `sports` and `odds` modules.
    -   Perform end-to-end testing of the data display and update functionalities.

### Phase 3: Prediction Engine and Analytics Module Integration (Weeks 9-12)

-   **Goal:** Isolate the prediction engine and implement the analytics module.
-   **Backend:**
    -   Create the `predictions` and `analytics` modules.
    -   Migrate the AI/ML prediction engine and implement the analytical services.
    -   Refactor the prediction and analytics API endpoints.
-   **Frontend:**
    -   Refactor the components that display predictions and analytical insights.
    -   Develop new components for visualizing analytical data.
-   **Integration:**
    -   Integrate the frontend components with the new backend prediction and analytics APIs.
    -   Ensure that predictions are displayed accurately and that analytical insights are presented clearly.
-   **Testing:**
    -   Develop unit and integration tests for the `predictions` and `analytics` modules.
    -   Perform end-to-end testing of the prediction and analytics functionalities.

### Phase 4: Final Integration and Unification (Weeks 13-16)

-   **Goal:** Complete the integration of all modules and unify the development workflows.
-   **Backend:**
    -   Complete the refactoring of any remaining backend components.
    -   Ensure that all modules are loosely coupled and communicate through well-defined interfaces.
-   **Frontend:**
    -   Complete the refactoring of all frontend components.
    -   Ensure a consistent and cohesive user experience.
-   **Integration:**
    -   Perform a final integration of all refactored components and modules.
    -   Conduct thorough end-to-end testing of the entire application.
-   **Unification:**
    -   Unify the frontend and backend development workflows, including a single CI/CD pipeline and a unified testing strategy.
    -   Update all documentation to reflect the new architecture and codebase.

## 2. Unification of Development Workflows

To ensure a seamless and efficient development process, the frontend and backend development workflows will be unified:

-   **Single CI/CD Pipeline:** A single, unified CI/CD pipeline will be created to build, test, and deploy both the frontend and backend. This will ensure that every code change is automatically tested and that the application is always in a deployable state.
-   **Unified Testing Strategy:** A unified testing strategy will be implemented, with a clear definition of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for both the frontend and backend. This will ensure comprehensive test coverage and high-quality code.
-   **Shared Development Environment:** A shared development environment will be established using Docker Compose, allowing developers to easily run the entire application stack on their local machines.
-   **Consistent Coding Standards:** Consistent coding standards and best practices will be enforced for both the frontend and backend through the use of linters, code formatters, and code reviews.

## 3. Data Migration and Consistency

During the refactoring process, it is crucial to ensure data migration and consistency:

-   **Database Schema Evolution:** Any changes to the database schema will be managed using a database migration tool (e.g., Alembic). This will ensure that database changes are applied in a controlled and reversible manner.
-   **Data Consistency Checks:** Data consistency checks will be implemented to ensure that data remains consistent during the refactoring process. This may involve writing scripts to validate data integrity and identify any inconsistencies.
-   **Zero-Downtime Migration:** For critical data, a zero-downtime migration strategy will be employed to minimize disruption to users. This may involve techniques such as blue-green deployments or canary releases.

## 4. Cross-Module Dependency Management

To ensure loose coupling and maintainability, cross-module dependencies will be managed carefully:

-   **Well-Defined Interfaces:** Modules will communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces (e.g., REST APIs, message queues). Direct database access between modules will be strictly prohibited.
-   **Dependency Injection:** FastAPI's dependency injection system will be used to manage dependencies between modules, promoting testability and reusability.
-   **Shared Libraries:** Any shared code or utilities will be placed in a separate `shared` library to avoid code duplication.

## 5. Documentation

The integration and unification roadmap will be documented in detail, including:

-   **Phased Integration Plan:** A detailed plan for each phase of the integration process, including specific tasks, timelines, and deliverables.
-   **Unified Workflow Documentation:** Clear documentation of the unified development workflows, including the CI/CD pipeline, testing strategy, and coding standards.
-   **Data Migration Plan:** A detailed plan for data migration and consistency, including any necessary scripts or tools.
-   **Dependency Management Guidelines:** Clear guidelines for managing cross-module dependencies and communication.

This comprehensive integration and unification roadmap will ensure a smooth and successful transition to the new modular monolith architecture, resulting in a more maintainable, scalable, and high-quality application.
