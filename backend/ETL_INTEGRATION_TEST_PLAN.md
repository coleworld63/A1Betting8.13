# ETL Integration Test Plan

## Test Areas

### 1. Data Integrity

- Verify all required fields are present and correctly mapped
- Ensure deduplication logic prevents duplicate records
- Validate foreign key relationships and referential integrity
- Check for correct upsert behavior (insert/update)

### 2. Error Handling

- Simulate missing/invalid fields and confirm proper logging/quarantine
- Test retry logic for transient errors (network/API/database)
- Validate alerting for critical failures
- Ensure failed records do not corrupt pipeline state

### 3. Performance

- Measure batch and incremental processing speed
- Test pipeline under high data volume
- Monitor resource usage and scalability

## Example Test Cases

- ETL job processes valid sample data and loads to database
- ETL job encounters invalid data and logs/quarantines it
- ETL job retries on simulated network/API failure
- ETL job upserts existing records without duplication
- ETL job triggers alert on critical error

## July 2025 Integration Test Results

- ETL sample module executed successfully.
- Extract and transform stages processed sample data as expected.
- Load stage was skipped due to absence of a database session (by design).
- No errors or exceptions occurred; logging is robust.

### Recommendations

- Use a mock or real SQLAlchemy session for future tests to validate load/upsert logic.
- Expand test coverage to include error scenarios and performance under load.
