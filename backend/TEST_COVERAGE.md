## EnhancedMLModelPipeline Unified Service Integration

### Coverage Summary

- Pipeline initialization (async, unified services)
- Data ingestion (unified_data_fetcher)
- Data preprocessing (unified_cache_service)
- Feature engineering (scaling, encoding, caching)
- Model training (sklearn, xgboost, lightgbm, tensorflow, pytorch)
- Error handling (missing cache key, invalid arguments)

### Test Rationale

- Validate migration to unified services for all pipeline stages
- Ensure robust error handling and type safety
- Confirm async orchestration and modular execution

### Scenarios

- Initialization with unified services
- Data ingestion and cache integration
- Preprocessing with cache validation
- Feature engineering with scaling/encoding
- Model training (basic coverage, extensible)
- Error handling for missing/invalid arguments

### Next Steps

- Expand coverage for model evaluation, deployment, prediction serving, and monitoring
- Add concurrency and integration tests for large datasets
- Document rationale for any legacy code retained
