# ETL Implementation Plan

## Modular Tasks & Milestones

### 1. Extract Stage

- Implement provider API clients (REST, WebSocket, etc.)
- Fetch raw data (JSON, CSV, XML)
- Handle authentication and rate limiting
- Milestone: Provider data successfully fetched and logged

### 2. Transform Stage

- Clean and normalize raw data
- Validate required fields and value ranges
- Deduplicate records
- Map provider fields to internal schema
- Milestone: Clean, validated, deduplicated data ready for loading

### 3. Load Stage

- Upsert records into the database using SQLAlchemy ORM
- Handle transactional integrity and error logging
- Milestone: Data loaded into database with upsert logic and error handling

### 4. Integration & Testing

- Advanced Integration Test Results (July 2025):
  - ETL sample module successfully integrated with test SQLite database.
  - Match table created and records inserted as expected.
  - Upsert logic validated; no duplicate records.
  - Logging confirmed for all actions.
  - No errors or exceptions occurred during normal operation.
  - Next steps: Simulate error scenarios and test with larger datasets for performance analysis.

Lessons Learned: - Real database integration is essential for validating upsert logic and data integrity. - Logging at each stage provides clear traceability and aids debugging. - Modular design allows rapid iteration and testing of individual pipeline stages.

Recommendations: - Continue testing with error scenarios and larger datasets. - Document any architectural challenges and solutions for future maintainers.

- Develop integration tests for each stage
- Validate data integrity, error handling, and performance
- Initial test run (July 2025):
  - ETL sample module executed successfully.
  - Extract and transform stages processed sample data as expected.
  - Load stage was skipped due to absence of a database session (by design).
  - No errors or exceptions occurred; logging is robust.
- Recommendations:
  - For future tests, use a mock or real SQLAlchemy session to validate load/upsert logic and database integration.
  - Expand test coverage to include error scenarios and performance under load.
- Milestone: All integration tests pass; pipeline is robust and reliable

### 5. Documentation & Handover

- Document code, configuration, and operational procedures
- Record any deviations or improvements
- Milestone: Documentation complete and ready for onboarding/maintenance
