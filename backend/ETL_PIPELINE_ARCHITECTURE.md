# ETL Pipeline Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for a modular, maintainable ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline supporting both historical and real-time data integration for sports analytics.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Extract

- Connect to provider APIs (REST, WebSocket, etc.)
- Fetch raw data (JSON, CSV, XML)
- Support for batch and incremental extraction
- Handle authentication and rate limiting

### 4. Monitoring & Alerting

- Integrate with ELK stack, Sentry, or Datadog for centralized log aggregation and error tracking.
- Set up alerting for critical errors, performance bottlenecks, and failed ETL jobs (email, Slack, etc.).
- Track ETL job metrics (duration, throughput, error rate) for continuous improvement.

### 2. Transform

- Clean and normalize data
- Validate required fields and value ranges
- Deduplicate records from overlapping sources
- Map provider fields to internal schema
- Enrich data (e.g., add metadata, calculate derived fields)

### 3. Load

- Insert/update records in the database using SQLAlchemy ORM
- Handle upserts (insert or update as needed)
- Log successful and failed operations
- Support transactional integrity

## Batch and Incremental Updates

- **Batch Updates:**

  - Use scheduled jobs (e.g., cron, Airflow, Prefect) to process large historical datasets at regular intervals.
  - Support parallel processing for efficiency.
  - Ensure idempotency to avoid duplicate loads.
  - Archive raw data for audit and reprocessing.

- **Incremental Updates:**

  - Use polling, webhooks, or event-driven triggers to fetch new/changed data in near real-time.
  - Maintain state (e.g., last processed timestamp, record ID) to ensure continuity and avoid gaps.
  - Implement checkpointing and recovery for reliability.
  - Monitor for missed or delayed updates and alert as needed.

- **State Management:**
  - Store ETL state in a dedicated table or file (e.g., ETL metadata table in the database).
  - Track job status, last run time, and error history for each provider/source.
  - Use transactional updates to ensure consistency.

## Logging and Exception Handling

**Centralized Logging & Monitoring:**

- Use the custom `FeatureLogger` class for structured logging (JSON/text), file output, and integration with Sentry for error tracking.
- Log at appropriate levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG) for each pipeline stage.
- Output logs in structured format (JSON/text) for easy parsing and monitoring.
- Include context in logs (source, job ID, record ID, timestamp).
- Integrate with external log aggregators (ELK stack, Sentry, Datadog) for production.
- Prometheus metrics are exposed for ETL job success/failure, record counts, and duration. Metrics endpoint runs on port 8001.
- Health check endpoint/function validates ETL readiness.
- Alerting for critical errors is supported via Slack webhook and email (configurable via environment variables).

**Exception Handling & Alerting:**

- Catch and categorize exceptions at each stage (extract, transform, load).
- Implement retry logic for transient errors (network, API rate limits, database locks).
- Log all exceptions with stack trace and relevant context using FeatureLogger and Sentry.
- Quarantine failed records for later review and reprocessing.
- Alert on critical failures via Slack/email and monitoring tools.
- Prometheus metrics track error rates and job failures for automated alerting.

## Validation & Deduplication

- **Validation Rules:**

  - Specify required fields for each data type (e.g., match_id, team_name, odds).
  - Enforce value ranges and formats (e.g., date formats, numeric ranges, allowed enums).
  - Validate foreign key relationships (e.g., team exists for match).
  - Use schema validation libraries (e.g., `pydantic`, `marshmallow`) for structured data.
  - Log and quarantine invalid records for review.

- **Deduplication Logic:**
  - Use unique constraints in the database (e.g., match_id, provider_id).
  - Generate hashes or composite keys for incoming records to detect duplicates.
  - Compare incoming data against existing records before insert/update.
  - Quarantine or log duplicates for audit and analysis.

## Error Handling Strategies

- **Retry Logic:**

  - Implement exponential backoff for transient errors (network, API rate limits, database locks).
  - Limit maximum retry attempts to avoid infinite loops.
  - Use circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.

- **Error Logging:**

  - Log errors with full context (source, payload, exception, timestamp).
  - Store error logs in a persistent system (file, database, log aggregator).
  - Categorize errors by severity and type for analysis.

- **Alerting:**
  - Integrate with alerting systems (email, Slack, PagerDuty) for critical failures.
  - Set up thresholds and triggers for automated alerts.
  - Provide actionable error messages for rapid response.

## Extensibility

- Modular design: Each stage is a separate function/class
- Easy to add new providers or data sources
- Configurable via YAML/JSON settings

## Next Steps

- Implement ETL modules for each provider
- Develop integration tests for pipeline reliability
- Document code and provide usage examples

## July 2025 Advanced Integration Test Results & Lessons Learned

- ETL pipeline successfully integrated with test SQLite database.
- End-to-end data flow and upsert logic validated; no duplicate records.
- Logging at each stage confirmed for traceability and debugging.
- Modular design enabled rapid iteration and isolated testing of pipeline stages.
- No errors or exceptions during normal operation; robust error handling in place.
- Next steps: Simulate error scenarios and test with larger datasets for performance analysis.

### Architectural Challenges & Solutions

- Ensuring upsert logic works as intended required real database integration.
- Modular pipeline design simplified debugging and future extensibility.
- Logging and error handling are critical for maintainability and reliability.

## ETL Code Template (Python)

```python
import logging
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

def extract_data(api_client):
    # Fetch raw data from provider
    return api_client.get_data()

def transform_data(raw_data):
    # Clean, validate, deduplicate, and map fields
    return [transform_record(r) for r in raw_data]

def load_data(session: Session, records):
    # Upsert records into the database
    for record in records:
        upsert_record(session, record)

def etl_job(api_client, session):
    try:
        raw_data = extract_data(api_client)
        records = transform_data(raw_data)
        load_data(session, records)
        logging.info(f"ETL job completed: {len(records)} records processed.")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"ETL job failed: {e}", exc_info=True)
        # Retry or alert as needed
```
