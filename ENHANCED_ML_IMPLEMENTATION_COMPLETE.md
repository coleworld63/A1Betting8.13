## üîß Integration with Existing Systems

### BestBetSelector Integration
The enhanced ML capabilities seamlessly integrate with existing prediction engines:

```python
# Original BestBetSelector function
async def best_bet_selector(game_id: str, features: Dict[str, float]):
    # Existing prediction logic
    return {"prediction": 0.65, "confidence": 0.82}

# Enhanced version with full ML capabilities
from backend.routes.enhanced_ml_routes import integrate_enhanced_prediction

async def enhanced_best_bet_selector(game_id: str, features: Dict[str, float]):
    return await integrate_enhanced_prediction(
        best_bet_selector, game_id, features
    )
```

### FinalPredictionEngine Integration
Same pattern applies to FinalPredictionEngine and any other prediction service:

```python
# Register the engine's model
enhanced_prediction_integration.register_prediction_model(
    model_name="FinalPredictionEngine_v1",
    model=final_prediction_model,
    sport="MLB",
    batch_predict_fn=final_prediction_model.predict_batch
)

# All predictions automatically get:
# - SHAP explanations
# - Performance logging
# - Batch optimization
# - Caching
# - Monitoring
```

## üìä Performance Monitoring Dashboard

The system provides comprehensive monitoring through the API:

```bash
# Real-time metrics
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/enhanced-ml/monitor/real-time"

# Performance comparison
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/enhanced-ml/performance/compare" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"sport": "MLB", "bet_type": "over_under"}'

# Health check
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/enhanced-ml/health"
```

## üöÄ Production Readiness

### Integrated into Main App
The enhanced ML routes are integrated into `backend/core/app.py`:

```python
# Enhanced ML Routes with SHAP Explainability, Batch Optimization, Performance Logging
try:
    from backend.routes.enhanced_ml_routes import router as enhanced_ml_router
    _app.include_router(enhanced_ml_router)
    logger.info("‚úÖ Enhanced ML routes included (/api/enhanced-ml/* endpoints)")
except ImportError as e:
    logger.warning(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Could not import enhanced ML routes: {e}")
```

### Graceful Fallbacks
All services include graceful fallbacks:
- **Missing Dependencies**: Services work even if numpy/scipy/shap are unavailable
- **Service Failures**: Individual service failures don't break the system
- **Import Errors**: Comprehensive error handling with fallback implementations

### Comprehensive Testing
Includes complete demo script (`enhanced_ml_demo.py`) that demonstrates:
