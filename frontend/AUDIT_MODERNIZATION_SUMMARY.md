# Frontend Audit & Modernization Summary

**Date:** July 23, 2025

## Documentation Improvements

- Added module-level docstrings and JSDoc comments to all critical files in `utils/`, `services/`, and `contexts/`.
- Ensured all exported functions, classes, and interfaces are documented for clarity and maintainability.

## Testing Improvements

- Added robust or basic test files for:
  - `utils/encryption.ts`
  - `utils/DataPipeline.ts`
  - `services/analytics/userPersonalizationService.ts`
  - All context providers: `AppContext.tsx`, `WebSocketContext.tsx`, `ThemeContext.tsx`, `MetricsContext.tsx`
- Confirmed existing robust tests for `utils/location.ts` and `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`.

## Best Practices & Anti-patterns

- Fixed all naming and scoping issues in context providers (`_AppContext`, `_ThemeContext`, `_WebSocketContext`, `_MetricsContext`).
- Refactored variable names in `WebSocketContext.tsx` for clarity and correctness.
- Removed or replaced unused `@ts-expect-error` directives where possible.

## Next Steps

- Run all tests to ensure correctness and robustness.
- Continue to monitor for any further anti-patterns or outdated code as the codebase evolves.
