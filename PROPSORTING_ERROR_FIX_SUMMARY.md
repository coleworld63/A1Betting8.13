# PropSorting Error Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The user encountered a React error in the browser console:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'sortBy')
    at PropSorting (PropSorting.tsx:39:26)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The error was occurring because the `PropSorting` component was receiving props that didn't match its expected interface.

**Expected Props (from PropSortingProps interface):**

- `sorting: PropSortingType` ‚ö†Ô∏è **MISSING**
- `onSortingChange: (sorting: Partial<PropSortingType>) => void` ‚ö†Ô∏è **MISSING**
- `className?: string` ‚úÖ

**Provided Props (in PropOllamaContainer.tsx):**

- `sortBy={state.sorting.sortBy}` ‚ùå **WRONG PROP NAME**
- `onSortChange={sortBy => actions.updateSorting({ sortBy })}` ‚ùå **WRONG PROP NAME**

## Error Location

**File:** `frontend/src/components/sorting/PropSorting.tsx`
**Line 39:** `value={sorting.sortBy}`

The `sorting` prop was `undefined` because the wrong prop name was being passed, causing the `.sortBy` access to fail.

## PropSorting Interface

```typescript
interface PropSortingProps {
  sorting: PropSortingType;
  onSortingChange: (sorting: Partial<PropSortingType>) => void;
  className?: string;
}

export interface PropSorting {
  sortBy:
    | "confidence"
    | "odds"
    | "impact"
    | "alphabetical"
    | "recent"
    | "manual"
    | "analytics_score";
  sortOrder: "asc" | "desc";
}
```

## Solution Implemented

**File:** `frontend/src/components/containers/PropOllamaContainer.tsx`
**Lines 63-67:** Fixed the prop names to match the PropSorting interface:

### Before (Incorrect)

```tsx
<PropSorting
  sortBy={state.sorting.sortBy}
  onSortChange={(sortBy) => actions.updateSorting({ sortBy })}
/>
```

### After (Correct)

```tsx
<PropSorting sorting={state.sorting} onSortingChange={actions.updateSorting} />
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Prop Names

- **`sortBy` ‚Üí `sorting`**: Now passes the entire sorting object as expected
- **`onSortChange` ‚Üí `onSortingChange`**: Matches the expected callback prop name

### 2. Simplified Prop Passing

- **Before**: Manually extracted `sortBy` from state and created a wrapper function
- **After**: Pass the entire `state.sorting` object and direct `actions.updateSorting` reference

### 3. Interface Compatibility

- The `actions.updateSorting` function signature matches `onSortingChange` exactly:
  - Expected: `(sorting: Partial<PropSorting>) => void`
  - Provided: `(sorting: Partial<PropSorting>) => void` ‚úÖ

## Verification

- ‚úÖ PropSorting component now receives correctly named props
- ‚úÖ `sorting.sortBy` access should work properly
- ‚úÖ Component interfaces properly satisfied
- ‚úÖ No more "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors

## Impact

- **Fixed:** React runtime error preventing PropSorting component from rendering
- **Improved:** User experience - sorting controls now work properly
- **Enhanced:** Type safety and proper prop interface matching

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/components/containers/PropOllamaContainer.tsx`
   - Fixed PropSorting component prop names to match interface

## Additional Notes

- The PropList component usage was verified and is correct (it expects `sortBy: string`)
- No other similar prop interface issues were found in the container

## Status

üü¢ **RESOLVED** - The PropSorting error has been fixed by correcting the prop names to match the component interface.
